# This is a configuration for the Kustomize namespace transformer [1].
#
# It ensures that when we set the namespace using the "namespace:" option
# in kustomization.yaml that references to the namespace are updated appropriately.
#
# Kustomize knows how to do this for native Kubernetes resources, but needs an
# explicit configuration for CRDs.
